# TAWAS
An idl script for solving the wave equation for torsional Alfven waves in a viscous plasma in static equilibrium with an axisymmetric, force-free magnetic field with no azimuthal component. The solution is calculated using the analytical formula presented in NAMEOFPAPER. 

## Usage

## Parameters

The parameters that can be changed are at the begining of the code. These parameters are:

| b0     | Background magnetic field strength                                |
| rho0   | Characteristic density                                            |
| rsize  | number of cells in redial direction                               |
| zsize  | number of cells in vertical direction                             |
| rdim   | dimension of domain in the radial direction                       |
| zdim   | dimension of domain in the vertical direction                     |
| H      | magnetic scale height                                             |
